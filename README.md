# Bean CMS

A micro-CMS built with [redbean](https://redbean.dev).

## Installation

There are currently two ways to run Bean CMS.

### Executable

1. Download the latest release from the [Releases](https://github.com/kevinfiol/cms/releases) page.
2. On MacOS/Linux, make `beancms.com` executable with `chmod +x beancms.com`.
3. On Windows/MacOS/Linux, run `./beancms.com -D ./`.

Note: The `-D` flag is required for Bean CMS to be able to serve user uploaded images from the current directory.

On some Linux systems with Wine installed you might run into some issues running `beancms.com`. See [redbean.dev/#linux](https://redbean.dev/#linux).

### Docker

A Docker Compose file is included in the project. Currently, Bean CMS is not on Docker Hub.

Steps to run with Docker:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kevinfiol/beancms.git
cd beancms
docker compose up -d --build beancms
```

Note: Environment variables can be defined in `.env`. See `.env.defaults` for default values.

## Development

System dependencies required for building:

* `make`
* `zip`

Note: [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) is required for `make watch` to work.

```bash
# download dev dependencies
make download

# run
make run

# or start service and watch for changes
make watch
```
